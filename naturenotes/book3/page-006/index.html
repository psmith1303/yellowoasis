      <p>&hellip;&amp; chestnut underparts contrasted well against its slaty coloured back &amp; head. I was surprised at its size being larger in the body than a blackbird in fact between sizes of a Blackie &amp; Moorhen, a clear impression of a very round shaped bird.</p>

<p>From where the track meets the secondary road we turned left as far as East Croachy &amp; on the first</p>

<p>After leaving the Dipper the road passes an unnamed lock surrounded by pines &amp; Rodedendrons &amp; here in broad daylight not more than 25ft from us was a lovely L.E.Owl sitting on an open fence post the ear tufts showed up very clearly. As I opened a door it flew on long spread wings into the pines.</p>

<p>From where the track meets the secondary road we turned left as far as East Croachy &amp; on the first small pond on the right we were very delighted to see a pair of Slavonian Grebes in full sunlight they looked beautiful, also on this pond was a Little grebe. Water lilies &amp; M. Marigold were blooming making a nice picture. Forward on to Loch Ruthven where we stopped for tea &amp; watched Common &amp; B.H Gulls. As we started off again we saw our first Corvus Cornix on a fence post, more young Lapwings were ringed here. Forward on to Loch Dun Teilchaig &amp; Loch Ashie &amp; here were were further rewarded with 2 pairs of S.Grebes &amp; a nest of 2 eggs &amp; another S.Eared Owl &amp; further Lapwing young to ring. Quite a few Hares &amp; rabbits were about &amp; another L.E.Owl in flight.</p>
