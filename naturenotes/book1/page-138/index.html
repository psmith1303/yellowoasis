<p>&ldquo;Enjoying a brief stay in New Forest. Yesterday was blazing hot and we explored some of the farms &ldquo;Aurelians&rdquo; country. But nothing much on wing - probably a late season. Too many conifers, too, I&rsquo;m afraid! Today we are en route to Swanage. Hope to see some Lepidoptera + stonechats on cliffs. See you at weekend. Regards. Joe.&ldquo;Business card from:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Essex wild-life survey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loose leaf field notes entry:</p>

<p>21.6.64   B.F. G.E. AKWAbberton Area, Roman River Valley</p>

<p>A rather bad day of cold rain &amp; at first a promise of sun. B.F. was unable to show us where the wild strawberries were which he found the previous Wed evening. We walked to Radcliffes ground without much event in the cold morning apart from Jays &amp; Magpies. From the tower we saw a Mallard on the pond &amp; Moorhen &amp; young. Turtle Doves were seen also from here. No sign of the Kestrel, for which we were observing from the tower. The Yellow Flag was blooming, more this year. While Bedstraw was quite abundant &amp; clumps of Dyers Greenweed was coming up &amp; in bud.</p>

<p>Not much in the old sand pits, but on our way there, the Cuckoo flew over. Long tailed tits &amp; young were watched &amp; a large party of mixed tits were foraging in the hedgerow. Over to the new conifer plantation &amp; to see large patches of Cow wheat blooming well. As was Honeysuckle &amp; Foxglove. Centaury was in bud. Back to the road &amp; over the bridge &amp; back along the river we noticed that the effect of spraying was to curl the flower stems of Flowering Rush, otherwise the effect of spray did not effect these plants, although other reed was seared off &amp; Willow Herb &amp; Teasel. A Mallard &amp; young disappeared in the ditch &amp; a Moorhen. Nice patches of Arum berries were noted. Back through the old garden area &amp; here to see Reed Bunting young &amp; &#9794; Yellowhammer &amp; young. By the ammo huts we noticed Weld in flower. Field Bindweed &amp; more Centaury. Many Linnets &amp; Goldfinches in this area also. On to Rock Farm &amp; coffee with Ma. Outside the house were lovely blooming Mullein &amp; Biting Stone crop well in flower. Into Charlottes grove to see Dogs Stink horn and Blackcap &#9794;. Out down to the river here spraying has seared most things. Many Swifts &amp; Martins &amp; Swallows seen all morning.</p>

<p>As we made our way back to the car the sun came out &amp; we saw a pair of Skippers, a common Blue &amp; a Meadow brown.</p>
