<dd><p>&hellip;could be heard with their harsh cries, as rooks flew overhead, &amp; a Kestrel was seen near the wood&rsquo;s edge.</p></dd>
<dd><p>The plants in the wood had not advanced much in a week except Lords &amp; Ladies. The bluebells promise a very good show. A few plants of primroses remain in the middle of the wood.
We departed about 12-20 &amp; when leaving we saw one Bullfinch in Ramparts Lane.</p></dd>

<dd><p>First Part Resavoir latter Friday Wood
At 6.30am over to Abberton Resavoir with my wife P.W. The weather was very cold &amp; frosty &amp; the water was cover over with fog reducing visibility to about 30ft. A bird flew up as we stopped &amp; I believe it was a &#9794; Smew, a Heron flew up as well. There were quite a few Tufted duck &#9794; &amp; &#9792; G.C. Grebes which were giving their courtship display &amp; calls. Two Ringed Plover were feeding at the water edge. Many minnows were seen under the bridge, they were lying on their sides &amp; gradually right themselves, it seemed as though they were playing a game. Hundreds of coot were packed along the water&rsquo;s edge &amp; moved out as we went near. The call of the widgeon was very plain &amp; heard a lot. On the other causeway, one Snipe flew up &amp; away. Two Shelducks flew over. A Cock Reed Bunting was feeding at the waters edge &amp; so was a Pied Wagtail.</p></dd>
<dd><p>The main reason for the visit, was to see the newly formed heronry in the trees, behind Gen Wainwrights&hellip;</p></dd>
