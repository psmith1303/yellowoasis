<dd>With members of C.N.H.S. on field meeting, by coach via Abberton Resavoir for a look around the salt marsh at Tollesbury here were found the more common salt plants, with an abundance of [_______________] whose origin was supposed to have been introduced by troops who put this in their kitbags, &amp; it has spread rapidly. After lunch here we carried on to the same type habitat only at Goldhanger. A Lingard was found right away &amp; then another. The first interesting birds seen were two Herons &amp; about 4-5 Ringed Plover. Along the sea wall dyke were a pair of Hedge Warblers &amp; the nest found with five young were moving along in front of us for a few hundred yards. All along the wall was the evidence of Sea-Beet sprayed with hormone &amp; the effect of the drift on nearby plants, all dying off after out-growing themselves. Leaving the sea wall we followed a large area of shingle for a couple of hundred yards &amp; here was found one egg in an Oyster Catchers nest. J. Firmin called to an agitated Redshank very effectively. Another Heron was spotted in a pose which camouflaged it excellently, by the side of a bolder or piece of wood on the mudflat. Some eggs of the Emperor Moth were found on a piece of grass &amp; later the &#9794; moth was seen flying around&hellip;</dd>
