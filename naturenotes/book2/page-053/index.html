      <p>With Brian Frost, George Evans &amp; two sons we visited the wood &amp; area above.</p>

<p>The weather was quite foggy at about 9-00 &amp; we entered the private wood to go to a mammal trap which I had set the previous night at 10 o&rsquo;clock &amp; baited with cheese bread &amp; split peas. To our amazement the trap was sprung but no mammals although the bait had been nibbled &amp; quite a few leaves were in it. We could only assume that the trap was spring by mice &amp; that they were small enough to get through the &frac12; wire mesh.</p>

<p>We carried on through the wood to the river where we crossed over a broken bridge, on to the hedgerow which contains a lesser S. Woodpecker hole &amp; which B.F. photographed for me, whilst he was doing this G.E. &amp; myself went over along the river. I was standing by an old rotten tree &amp; whith a rush &amp; whir of wings a lovely Kingfisher flew by, upstream. We all carried along the river &amp; B.F. saw a Green Sandpiper &amp; I only heard it the description Brian gave fitted this bird.</p>

<p>We heard and saw the G.S.W. drumming &amp; the L.S.W. as well. The Green. W. seemed everywhere in voice &amp; sight several times.
Making our way back to the bikes we took &amp; had our coffee in the wood, from here we inspected probable sights for Squirrel drays, I wandered down the wood again &amp; watched&hellip;</p>
