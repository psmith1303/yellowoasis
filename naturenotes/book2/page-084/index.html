      <p>&hellip;several Bar tailed Godwits &amp; one Black tailed Godwit, the bar tails had one or two in summer plumage, &amp; very nice as was the Knot looking very rust red in colour. We left this hide &amp; carried on back past the other hides &amp; wardens hut down the island to the furthermost lagoon here from the hide we saw one or two more Avocets wading &amp; feeding &amp; on the nests.
