      <p>With G.E. &amp; N.D. we arrived about 8.20 &amp; walked down to the pipes over the Roman River, admiring the flowers by the banks, which included Purple Loosestrife, Branched bur reed, Trifid-Bur-marigold, Teasel, Common St Johns Wort, Tansy &amp; Canadian Fleabane.</p>

<p>We sat on the pipes to check up on the Fleabane from the Collins field guide &amp; then we had coffee &amp; a snack. Whilst having a snack we watched a warbler on the reeds, with another bird which was a reed warbler, we climbed down for a closer look, just as a Green Sandpiper came flying up stream &amp; saw us &amp; turned back again. By all field characters this warbler fitted the description of a Marsh Warbler, unfortunately we never heard it sing, we checked this in Peterson&rsquo;s field guide. R.Leavett appeared just at this time, as the warbler flew away we told him of it &amp; then showed him some leaf cutter bees at work in the old bridge timbers. We extracted one pupa complete, the case made of dog rose leaves, the adult insect was captured as well. We timed one insect as it left the hole in the rotting wood &amp; it took 2 mins 20 secs before it returned again with the next piece of leaf, whilst we observed it six pieces were brought in. These leaf sections were cut from the point of the leaf &amp; the circled away from the main vein to the bottom edge, forming a spear like piece. Clive Marn &amp; Martin Thomas arrived &amp; continued watching the bees for a while longer. Once I took the leaf from the bee as it was going into the hole, it took no notice &amp; still went in, ignoring the leaf which I put in the entrance, as it came&hellip;</p>
