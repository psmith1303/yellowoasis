      <p>&hellip;I went off to try to better a Chiffchaff song, which was quite good when replayed, also the calls of mating Jays.</p>

<p>I returned to Brian and we both got in the 4&rsquo; x 4&rsquo; hide. We had heard &amp; recorded Green Woodpeckers calling &amp; the G.S. Woodpecker drumming a few minutes previously, when we heard the former call out again &amp; saw it fly into a holly tree, I mimiced its call &amp; it jerked its head up &amp; looked about &amp; called out, once again, to which I replied, its response to this was to fly on a tree very close to the hide &amp; giving us good views. It was trying to find one of its own. I believe our movement caused it to fly off &amp; it made a small circuit &amp; landed back on &amp; oak tree, more calling made this bird frantic, finally it flew to another part of the wood. I continued to mimic its laughing call. We were very surprised after a few minutes of calling, to have replies from at least three birds &amp; even further to our surprise we were excited when three birds landed near the bole of a medium-sized chestnut tree. We watched them chase each other &amp; they climbed &amp; descended very quickly in a spiral fashion round the tree, this carried on for a full three minutes before they flew off altogether accross the wood, after which we continued to hear them. This was to my mind a courtship display of two &#9794;&#9794; &amp; one &#9792;. There wasn&rsquo;t any sign of hostility towards each other. It did prove that the woodpeckers can be called up okay. During the rest of the morning we saw &amp; heard them several times more.</p>
