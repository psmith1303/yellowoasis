      <p>&hellip;these were his birds from his nearby pond.</p>

<p>Brian was photographing some nice looking moss, when the Colonel came out &amp; we chatted with him. He told us that he came out to look for some deer prints, as the previous evening he believed he heard a deer barking. We hope he was right. We walked with him down the track &amp; to the bridge. A Comma butterfly flew over &amp; we saw a moth (unknown species). There were nice patches of celandines lovely in the sun. we left the Col &amp; walked along the river to some Alders &amp; we were delighted to see four Siskins feeding on the cones, only one looked like a &#9794;. George saw a Kingfisher when the colonel first came out &amp; he flushed a G.S. Woodpecker which flew over into the wood. During the time in the wood we heard Greater &amp; lesser Spotted woodpeckers drumming. The lesser spotted&rsquo;s hole in the hedge tree was still untouched.</p>

<p>We made our way back across the remains of the old bridge &amp; along side the Col&rsquo;s wood, at the tope we saw a nice Tortoiseshell butterfly. During the course of the day we heard a few Jays &amp; saw one Magpie.</p>

<p>By this time, at about 1230, it was getting very warm &amp; only a slight breeze, as we left on our motor cycles.</p>
