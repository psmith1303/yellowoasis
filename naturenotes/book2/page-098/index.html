      <p>&hellip;watching a tree creeper, returning to its nest which contained one young.</p>

<p>A Heron flew up from the dyke &amp; made off towards the Resavoir.</p>

<p>We returned through the wood to the car disturbing a Green Woodpecker as we went through &amp; also investigating a rotten tree full of holes, but none inhabited, on arriving at the car, it rained fairly heavily whilst we had coffee for about 15 minutes, after this we watched a Chaffinch &amp; then a Blackcap, before leaving Brian.</p>

<p>George, Dickie, &amp; I carried on toward the Mersea road &amp; left the car &amp; M/cycle &amp; walked across the fields, to where we knew of a Green Woodpecker nesting in an oak tree.</p>

<p>G.E. &amp; myself climbed up armed with a net &amp; scope, both of which proved unsuccessful as the hole was too deep &amp; the bird which was with-in would not leave, until as we gave it up &amp; departed the bird flew off &amp; when we were a little distance away the assumed &#9794; bird flew in the direction of the nest. As we walked along I spotted a pair of Cream-spot tiger moths, which we collected &amp; hope to breed from, they were in excellent condition. We had a look round further down by the river which was quite high but not much other than Linnets &amp; a Goldfinch. We were very pleased with the morning out &amp; returned at approx. 1230.</p>
