<p>A coachload of C.N.H.S. members visited Royston Heath, Herts for the showing of the Anemone Pulsatilla. Leaving Colchester at 9.30, we picked up other members on route &amp; started off in weather mixed with cloud, sunshine &amp; a few showers. We eventually reached our destination around 11.30am. After a brief look over the grounds we all came back to the coach &amp; had lunch. My son David came with me, &amp; enjoyed every moment.
After lunch we went back over the slopes where the Pasque flower was really beautiful and plentiful &amp; presenting a lovely picture as the breeze blew &amp; nodded their heads. Here &amp; there were dotted quite a few Cowslips adding to the picture. Salad Burnet was growing plentifully as was Rock Rose (not yet in bloom either plant). One or two Barren strawberries were found. Twayblade was showing through in the beech wood &amp; the rarer lesser Hellorborine.
Many birds were singing well, among them were Nightingale, Wood Warbler, Tree Pipit, Chiffchaff, Black cap, Whitethroat &amp; all the other more common birds including Corn Bunting. During the bus journey to &amp; from Royston, Many pheasant were seen included one Melanistic form. Common &amp; French Partridge were seen. One or two pairs of Lapwing appeared to be breeding birds. A Cuckoo flew accross the path&hellip;
