<p>Title: Some observations on Kestrels</p>

<p>One of the most rewarding sights of bird watching are the displays of the hunting kestrel. The &lsquo;windhover&rsquo; to give the kestrel one of its local names, flies slowly across open ground or marsh, pausing now and then on rigid wings with only the tips fanning the air, to survey the area below. He moves slowly on, flying or gliding, until he sees his prey, then headfirst he dives, seizes it and flies away to a favourite perch to eat it. The kestrel&rsquo;s habit of perching in conspicuous places helps to make him well known to ornithologists.</p>

<p>Such sights observed during the early spring months and followed by the frequent visits of a pair of kestrels to a particular elm in the Colchester area led to the discovery, on May 7th, 1961, of a nest. Situated some fifteen feet above ground level the nest was located in a cavity where a large limb had broken off forming a platform three feet long and extending nine inches horizontally into the trunk. The platform was covered with leaf mould, twigs, droppings numerous pellets and fur of several small mammals.</p>

<p>When discovered the nest contained five eggs, this number subsequently proved to be the full clutch. Suffused over the whole of their surface with reddish brown, the eggs were heavily blotched with a purplish brown colour. One was easily distinguished from the others in that it was of a much lighter colouring.</p>

<p>Regular observations were made, and on May 20th, as the tree was being climbed the female flew off as she had done on previous occasions revealing four eyas&rsquo;s and one egg. One of the young had only just hatched and the shell was still evident. At this stage the young falcons were covered in a uniform creamy/white down, the legs and feet were yellow terminated with glossy black talons.</p>

<p>To avoid disturbance it was decided that close inspection and photography of the nest would be made once every week, but that visits to the immediate area would be made as frequently as possible.</p>

<p>On June 4th the young were photographed and were found to have grown somewhat larger. The colouration had changed but slightly. If one can correlate the amount of food consumed to the rate of growth, the number of mammals and other prey the parent birds had to find and catch, was very considerable, for with every visit made it was possible to see a great increase&hellip;</p>
