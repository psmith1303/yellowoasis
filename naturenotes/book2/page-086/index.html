      <p>About seven am with G.E. &amp; B.F. we visited the above area. G.E. &amp; myself arrived first &amp; upon parking the M/cycle we watched &amp; listened to the Marsh tits above us in the oaks first, then pines, then ash, trees. After a few minutes we decided to walk down to what we call the shrike field, just then B.F. came &amp; we three went over the field. We saw several Early purple orchids &amp; I was pleased, they looked so well &amp; a good colour mauve not as plentiful as other years, definately declining. There were quite a few White throats about here. Carrying on we went down by the river &amp; over to the tits nests in the L.S. Woodpecker hole, as we scraped the entrance a loud hiss took place so we promptly made a recording of it as the presumed &#9794; flitted above us. We walked back along the way we had come with the intention of going into the wood, when a Green Woodpecker called out &amp; made us return to search for any hole we may find, George &amp; Brian walked one side of the hedge &amp; I the other, they stopped &amp; looked in some trees their side &amp; I went on a little further &amp; found a perfectly new hole, with the chipping, on the bark &amp; on the ground. I climbed up &amp; investigated &amp; found it was as new as it looked, but I couldn&rsquo;t see inside even with our mirror device, we hope we&rsquo;ve found a G.Woodpeckers nest it last. We made observations from the fir copse but no birds turned up - only Dickie &amp; Godfrey. When they joined us we carried on to a line of old Willows where to our delight Green Woodpeckers were flying about, round many woodpecker holes in the willows, one at least was new with the tell tale chippings lying about. Again we observed&hellip;</p>
