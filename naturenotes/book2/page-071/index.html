      <p>With G.E. &amp; B.F. we arrived in the wood at about 7am. G.E. &amp; myself arrived first. Right away we entered the wood &amp; left our bait by the trees. From here we went through the wood &amp; out of it lower down &amp; then into the thickly covered field of brambles, blackthorn &amp; scrub. This sloping field overlooks the Roman River valley &amp; from here we watched three pairs of Shelducks, the males doing their little courtship bobbing of the head to the females, just then two &#9794; Wild Ducks (Mallard) winged in, &amp; settled near the Shelducks. We carried on down &amp; along the river, where a &#9794; &amp; &#9792; Reed Bunting were seen on the opposite bank, further along we spotted a Heron coming down in a far stream. Up as far as the pipes accross the river &amp; a pair of Blue tits seemed very anxious, just then we spotted another Heron in flight at which the first bird took off &amp; flew away in another direction. The bill of the first bird was quite orange &amp; the other was much lighter, perhaps &#9794; &amp; &#9792;.</p>

<p>We crossed the pipe &amp; was making for the hedge where we had found a L.S. Woodpecker&rsquo;s nest, when up flew a pair of Mallard, which circled around two or three times. We inspected the Long tailed tits nest &amp; found it empty, the eggs had gone. predators we think, &amp; not children, as the next was still intact if only slightly lopsided.</p>

<p>At this time B.F. arrived &amp; we reentered the wood. We looked at a nest of a Thrush with three eggs. A Blackbirds nest was still unfinished &amp; we continued through the wood.</p>
