      <p>G.E. was awoken by a pair of GSW chasing each other very close to the car &amp; giving him good views. He awoke me &amp; I just missed them as we moved. After breakfast we went up the slope &amp; watched Chaffinches &amp; Marsh tits &amp; then another GSW &#9794; flying into the fir wood. I called out several times imitating the G.Woodpecker, when to our sheer delight a Black Woodpecker few up the hill to our left &amp; over the pines out into another clearing &amp; on over some more pines out of sight. The bird was calling most of the time whilst in flight, we never saw it again after this. The flight was quite direct &amp; its size appeared as that of a Rook. The head &amp; neck where the crest meets were clearly seen as it flew over quickly. We walked through the woods where it went but no luck, although we did see three Red Squirrels. A woodpecker called out again &amp; we trecked through the forest to see a G.Woodpecker sitting at the top of an old Birch tree, it flew off as soon as it saw us. Tree pipits seemed plentiful here as were Chaffinches, the former displaying its parachute &amp; song flight, from the tall pines. A Whitethroat was also seen &amp; heard singing. Bullfinches we seen near the car a again later in the forest.</p>
