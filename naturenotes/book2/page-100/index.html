      <p>&hellip;in size of the five young. Noticeable too was the increased voraciousness and aggressiveness.</p>

<p>By Sunday, June 11th when the eyas&rsquo;s were fourteen days old the down had darkened to a bluish grey with the underparts almost white. On the wings the tips of the primaries were beginning to show. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the young kestrels were their chrome yellow feet which appeared extremely large, potentially strong and tipped with glossy black talons, dangerous. Above the steely blue hooked bill the ceres were yellow, wrinkled with fine black lines, whilst around the eyes a yellow ring of bare skin added to their ferocious appearance.</p>

<p>With each successive visit the young falcons interested us more and more for it soon became apparent that in character and temperament each bird was quite different. The larger of the five, (subsequently identified as a female), was very viscous, and any attempt to pick her up caused her to place her back against the side of the nest hole and strike with flashing talons at the offending hand, at the same time uttering shrill cries. At other times she would lie on her back and attempt to claw with both feet simultaneously. Conversely another of the young was quite placid and would allow handling, whilst a third would retire to the deepest recess at our approach.</p>

<p>On several occasions whilst the tree was being climbed the female parent left the nest and flew to an oak some six hundred yards away, there to perch on a dead limb to await our departure. This limb, high up in the tree was a favourite perching place of both parents and must have provided commanding views of the surrounding territory. On the evening of Friday, June 16th the male was seen at close range perching on a low branch of the nest tree, busily engaged preening. The female flew close to him, in fact almost at him, crying out, at which the male flew away to commence hawking.</p>

<p>The young were now nineteen days old. Their tail feathers and primaries sheathed in quills were well advanced. Through the greyish down signs of the rufous mantle and breast feathers could be seen. Instead of being huddled together as previously the birds, now considerably advanced in growth, were ranged along the dead bough and opened their beaks menacingly when approached.</p>
