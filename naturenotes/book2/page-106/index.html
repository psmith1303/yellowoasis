      <p>&hellip;Great Crested Grebe, then a G.H.Gull &amp; then an unidentified duck with head missing &amp; web footed. Merganser?</p>

<p>We left this area by nineish &amp; quite cold decided to go to park farm area, where upon arrival we had coffee &amp; a snack. We walked down the sloping field where a spring is running &amp; flushed a Snipe which pleased Brian &amp; it zig-zaged &amp; weaved away from us. A Lapwing &amp; two Moorhens also scurried away as we continued along the river past the pipe &amp; bridge a quick look at the bridge &amp; leaf cutter bee holes. A nice look at a small copper &amp; common blue pleased us, as we walked up into the wood. Here the undergrowth &amp; foliage had grown thicker &amp; Common enchanters nightshade was indeed quite thick &amp; common.</p>

<p>Blackcaps &amp; Chiffchaffs still lingered their songs &amp; we were pleased to hear them &amp; the harsh jay notes &amp; that of a Green Woodpecker. We went to the east side of the wood, where were delighted to see a Nuthatch &amp; a tree-creeper &amp; to find a Jay (probably a young bird with feather quills on head &amp; chin) at the foot of a tree with its head &amp; beak held fast by the grass &amp; roots at the foot of a Birch tree, it hadn&rsquo;t been dead much more than the previous day as it was intact with its eyes still in, we pulled quite hard to remove it &amp; kept the bird for its skull &amp; wings &amp; tarsus. We had to be going as time was getting on, I was just leaving Brian as a Tawny Owl flashed over the road into the Wood. The time was about 10-40.</p>

<p>Of note was the pair of Kestrels we saw hovering near the cottages, upon our arrival, probably &ldquo;our&rdquo; breeding pair.</p>
