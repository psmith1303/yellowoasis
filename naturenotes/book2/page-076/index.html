      <p>We carried on along the beach &amp; saw parties of Oyster Catcher &amp; a few Ringed Plover &amp; Dunlin &amp; one or two Turnstone&rsquo;s. Nice little parties of Sanderling had some birds in Summer Plumage &amp; looked very nice. Now &amp; then parties of Oyster-Catchers would fly up &amp; along the beach &amp; settle once again, doing this they showed their Black &amp; White plumage at its best.</p>

<p>A figure appeared behind us &amp; when it caught up to us, turned out to be Reg Arthur, one time Warden of Bardsey bird Sanctuary &amp; living at St Osyth. He joined us as we continued along the beach, &amp; we inspected a dead R.T.Diver, presumably oiled. Carrying on over the pebbly part of the beach R.A. found the first seasons Ringed Plover nest of two eggs, which was photographed and appears on the previous page. Later on R.A. found another of 4 eggs hard sat. The photograph was taken by B. Frost.</p>

<p>The high tides of previous weeks had made the beach was up to quite an angle, altering the appearance of other visits quite a bit. This was probably the cause of the two Paddle worms which we found eight feet apart near the tide line being washed up. They were alive when I found them so we took them back with us for the museum. However, they were dead the next day at the museum &amp; were put in formalin as tube specimens.</p>

<p>We carried on nearly to the end of the beach watching the Oyster catchers, Ringed Plover Turnstones &amp; Sanderling &amp; Meadow pipits &amp; Skylarks. After our about turn &amp; proceeding back, R.A. beckoned me to look at our first 61&rsquo; Swallows,&hellip;</p>
