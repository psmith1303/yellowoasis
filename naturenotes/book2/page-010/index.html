      <p>&hellip;then along to coast road to the west-end. Parking our cycles we walked along the beach and spotted a large party of Brents&rsquo;. We approached these carefully over the mud and had satisfying views. We got within a 100ft before they were disturbed and took flight in an easterly direction. There were 72 birds feeding and with other small parties which flew over feeding and with other small parties which flew over later the total was made up to approx. 100. Other birds feeding quite near the Brents&rsquo; were about six Curlews, a few Dunlin and Turnstone, one Oyster Catcher, all being well viewed.</p>

<p>Our best today was a pair of Ducks swimming and diving, with white flanks similar to Tufteds&rsquo;. Just then five ducks flew over and we all recognised them as Golden Eye, which was the first time for us all, that&rsquo;s what we made the birds swimming out to be. There were three more flew over as we made our way back along the tide-line.</p>

<p>Collecting our cycles we walked with them along the beach and found a beautiful &#9794; Widgeon in good condition, which I took and prepared as a skin, the cause of its death was not apparent. We had a quick look around the seaview avenue beach end, not much here, apart from C. Crows feeding on the sand banks. Also a couple of Grey Plover.</p>

<p>The weather was cold and the sky overcast, and rain threatening all day. It was enjoyable and we arrived home at 5.00. one Snipe &amp; L.T.Tit were also noted.</p>
