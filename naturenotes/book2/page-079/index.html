      <p>&hellip;&amp; replayed a tape recording of &ldquo;The New Auralians field day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From here we followed the river, seeing a &#9792; reed bunting on the vegetation on the river side, on the clump of Willow trees, tits were in these &amp; Linnets flew over. Accross the marshy fields we saw birds flying onto a fence on getting closer we saw they were our first Yellow Wagtails &#9794;&#9794; &amp; &#9792;&#9792;, of which during the morning we saw several pairs. One probable first year bird had us guessing for a while as to its identify it had no yellow at all, it main plumage was grey with a slight eye stripe &amp; two slight wing bars &amp; underparts uniform grey, later we saw an identical bird but with slight yellow underparts, which gave us the answer.</p>

<p>We carried on accross the field &amp; to the copse of poplars, looking for woodpeckers nests - no luck. George kept near a singing nightingale &amp; made a recording, whilst Brian &amp; I kept searching, during this time we had spells of very warm sunshine. A Heron flew down to the ditch &amp; was being mobbed by a Crow or Rook as it flew off again, which it gradually overtook &amp; flew on. A Green Woodpecker flew through the copse &amp; veered off &amp; away when it saw us. Another we saw, across the river flew up to an oak by the bridge. Shelduck &amp; Mallard were flying around all morning &amp; two more took up when we went back across a ditch.</p>

<p>Large patches of Cuckoo flowers were everywhere &amp; here &amp; there a few buttercups.</p>

<p>Our way back was over the pipe again &amp; white throats were singing &amp; flying into the gorse bushes, swallows flew up &amp;&hellip;</p>
