<dd><p>&hellip;so back up along side the wood on the old ramparts. The first big old oak tree, a had a mass of sticks &amp; grass &amp; on the other side we saw a mouse near it. I climbed up &amp; the animal went down the other, George, Brian &amp; Dicky grabbed out to catch it, but the mouse came up near me so I tried, but it changed it way again &amp; dashed past Dickie, who made a flying dive at it as it escaped down the bank into the wood. The mouse was probably a Long tailed wood mouse, it had big ears &amp; eyes &amp; a nice chestnut coloured fur, identity to be checked.</p></dd>
<dd><p>Without much more incident we made our way back through &amp; across the wood to our M/cycles after enjoying a good morning.</p></dd>
<dt>10.5.61 Same locality</dt>

B.F. arrived &amp; after he had looked over these horrible monstrosities, we went back down over the Shrike field &amp; with my new binoculars - a pair of 7x40 Kalimars Japanese, watched a low perched Cuckoo calling merrily &amp; a Chaffinch nearby. Here &amp; there Whitethroats flew up &amp; in song &ldquo;parachuted&rdquo; back to a perch. We made our way down to the river &amp; along to &amp; over the pipes, carrying on to the hedgerow to look at the G.Woodpeckers nest hole, to which there was no change, also the blue tit in the L.S.W. hole. Further over we looked at the tits nest of eight eggs &amp; a bird was sitting &amp; hissing as we looked. The bird looked like a Blue tit&hellip;</p></dd>
