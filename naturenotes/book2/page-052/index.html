      <p>&hellip;Great Crested Grebes, as well as two assumed C. Scoter, further out than these was one Red Throated Diver.</p>

<p>There were quite a few dead birds along the tide line &amp; these were. 2 Shelducks, 2 C. Scoters &#9794; &amp; &#9792;. 1 Curlew. 1 GBB (immature). 1 Brent Goose. 1 Red Throated Diver (oiled badly). 1 Common Gull &amp; the remains of a Redshank or Dunlin.</p>

<p>A party of eight Snow Buntings were seen at the end of the sand on shingle bank &amp; they appeared to be &#9792;&#9792;s &amp; immature birds, feeding in the gravel. Coming back however, we had excellent views from 7-8 ft of a lovely &#9794;. The bill was very noticeably yellow &amp; small cone shaped. This bird was alone.</p>

<p>We saw a &#9794; Greenfinch &amp; feeding nearby was a Goldfinch, other finches we noted were Linnets &amp; Sparrows.</p>

<p>After having lunch we waded in the low water pools for various types of seaweeds, which Russ collected and hoped to identify. We collected about a dozen different species.</p>

<p>We tried the other beach towards Jaywick, &amp; saw some more Brents, with gulls &amp; more Cormorants in flight. Coming back towards the sand-works we met J. Richardson &amp; N. Syer who were just out strolling.</p>

<p>Out departure was at about 4-40 &amp; as we got over the sea wall &ldquo;hump&rdquo; in the road we saw a Short Eared Owl flapping over the marsh.</p>

<p>It was quite a nice day out &amp; we arrived home at 5.35.</p>
