      <p>Today in town, watched gulls wheeling around, and noticed one was already in summer plumage. They were Black headed Gulls, this view strikes one as being quite early.</p>

<p>31 January and 1 February 1959, Colchester</p>

<p>Whilst cycling to job at reed hall, we looked up at some hawthorn threes along Reed hall avenue, and to my delight there were four, or five Waxwings. We stopped and got a few feet away, watching and listening to their trilling call. There seem to be the same sound from elsewhere and looking up in an Oak tree we saw more birds. The long hedge was all Hawthorn, so we walked along it and to our surprise the Waxwings we all along it. We can only make a rough estimate of the total, after counting twenty we saw more birds so stating approximately 25-30 birds was somewhere near.</p>

<p>John Mead was informed and R.L. &amp; I was with him when we showed him his first ever Waxwings. We all had lovely views with the bright sunshine upon them. John took cine pictures of them and should have good shots of the birds in pairs.</p>
