      <p>&hellip;party of twelve who were visiting the sanctuary. The warden kindly split us up in two parties &amp; we were on our own in each hide. From the first hide, very well made &amp; maintained we had lovely views of the Avocets from very close range, as the fed, waded &amp; flew &amp; sitting on their nests or standing in the water knee deep preening. I thought the bird looked its best when in flight or preening. The number there were estimated at 50 prs &amp; a lot of predation was done by the 3,500 gulls in the colony as told by the warden.

I went on to the hide &amp; saw more Avocets, Terns, Sandwich, Common &amp; little. Shelducks, here also we fair sized parties of Dunlin in summer plumage &amp; one Knot, a few Ringed plover.
