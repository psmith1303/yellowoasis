<dd>&hellip;the nice little Tree Creepers &amp; whilst watching these I saw a nice looking Red Squirrel &amp; called George &amp; the boys to see it before it leaped away out of sight. I was quite a nice morning out except for the fog which of course cleared it way to sunshine when we left at 12.30.</dd>

<dd><p>Mangles Wood Berechurch
With B.F. &amp; G.E. &amp; son Godfrey to see if our mammal traps had caught anything. B.F. set them. One in the chestnut grove &amp; one by the river bank in hope of catching a vole. Neither had been spring &amp; no catch.</p></dd>
<dd><p>We roamed around the wood &amp; through it to the river, here we saw another Kingfisher as we did last week. Green Woodpeckers were heard &amp; seen &amp; we heard the drumming of the G.S.Woodpecker. The L.S.Woodpecker&rsquo;s nest in the hedge-row was still untouched &amp; we had a quick look round.</p></dd>
<dd><p>Upon coming back to the wood we went to our bikes to get our coffee &amp; sheets &amp; sat under some holly trees to keep watch on a squirrel drey - nothing showed up &amp; we saw none at all. I saw a Nuthatch, &amp; this flew toward another which was calling out. These birds seemed very much in evidence when we first got into the wood calling out quite loud. Two long tailed tits flew from tree to tree quite close to us. A fair amount of bird song was heard &amp; the Dunnock was quite common, as was the Wren. Jays were plentiful &amp;&hellip;</p></dd>
