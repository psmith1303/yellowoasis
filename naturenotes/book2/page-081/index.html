      <p>The much awaited visit to Havergate started at approx; 7am. A party of six including George Evans, Brian Frost, Russell Leavett, Ken Crawshaw &amp; Mike Cant, met at the last mentioned home as a rendezvous &amp; we set off. Ken &amp; Mike went in one car &amp; the rest of us went in a Vauxhall Victor which B.F. had borrowed from his works.</p>

<p>Through Ipswich &amp; our first stop was at some woods near Butley. Here we saw quite a few Redstarts mostly &#9794;&#9794; &amp; only one or two &#9792;&#9792;. A Tree Pipit flew from a tree top singing merrily, as was a Robin on the roadside. The Cuckoo was calling regularly &amp; Shelduck we flying in circuits round a nearby field. The Green Woodpecker flew across a wood calling loudly. Four Jays chased each other calling harshly &amp; looking nice in the morning sun - a lovely fresh morning with a slight wind. Blackbirds &amp; Woodpigeons flew around the woods &amp; hedgerows , whilst Swifts flew &amp; wheeled overhead &amp; birdsong like a syphony with background music of the GSW Drumming. Pheasants &amp; partridges were seen regularly during the day. Nightingales were singing &amp; carried on all day.</p>

<p>From this roadside stop we carried on, only to stop a little further on to watch a Marsh tit, plucking fur from a dead flattened Rat on the roadside, on again, passing a Red Squirrell on the grass verge. We stopped again near a sand working, from which plenty of Sand Martins flew around &amp; about. We all walked down the road, watching a Starling, with it head emerging&hellip;</p>
