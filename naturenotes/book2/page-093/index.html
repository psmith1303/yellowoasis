      <p>On arrival in France, after flying from Southend the first bird we saw was a skylark. The airport seemed very quiet &amp; the dull weather didn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<p>With G.E. &amp; son we drove accross France in a Standard 8 car, and all our gear stored in the boot. We had hired two Sandfly tents in Colchester &amp; these we intended to sleep in, but supplies were only light as we expected to get Bed &amp; breakfast in Germany. Stop at Le Bateau for tea &amp; Nightingale.</p>

<p>The first few miles of France were not very interesting &amp; we motored all night, with a stop of two hours. Magpies we about the most seen bird en route. It was interesting to go through the French villages &amp; study the architecture &amp; the streets with no footpaths. Very noticeable was elderly women working on the painting &amp; even ditching round the houses &amp; more types of manual labour. The wine places or cafes stayed open quite late, &amp; opened early in the morning. In one village men were drinking in them at approx 6.45.</p>

<p>Our next stop, the next day 20.5.61 was at an old gravel pit working near Metz. We had breakfast &amp; took a &ldquo;stretcher&rdquo; &amp; looked around picking specimens of (&ldquo;Crested Cowheat?) that were lovely as was the Milkwort &amp; many other plants including Wayfaring tree, Red Campion various sedges. A moth was captured coming out of the C. Cowheat and a beetle nearby. As we prepared to leave here I spotted our first Buzzard of the day. Continuing on to [Germany] a nice view was had of the &#9794; R.B.Shrike sitting on telephone wires. More Buzzards &amp; three Kites were seen as we journeyed on having very good views of both species, flying &amp; perching.</p>

<p>Nearing Strasbourg on the G/F border, we were surprised to see a White Stork feeding in a cultivated field.</p>

<p>We passed over the border uneventfully &amp; into Germany.</p>
