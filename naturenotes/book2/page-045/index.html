<dd><p>A quick look along the R. Colne revealed some very nice plants of Arrowhead in bloom &amp; plenty of Yellow lily. It seems as though a good breeding season has been had by many species of fish which were in countless shoals. Young Roach &amp; many Gudgeon &amp; Sticklebacks.</p></dd>
<dd><p>Down the Roman River its much the same for fish &amp; quite a few sand Dabs. Its pleasing to see the flowering Rush is plentiful &amp; widespread. I saw one Kingfisher near the stretch to Col. Mangolds. Green Woodpeckers were seen &amp; heard very often. I felt very pleased &amp; lucky when I saw one black form of the Elephant Hawk Larva on Willow herb. I looked for more &amp; saw a dropping, on closer investigation I revealed a very nice green form after this I found four more of the green form. Now I hope to rear successfully.</p></dd>
<dd><p>These pupa have now pupated &amp; I have the chrysalis on corrugated paper. These were finally reared successfully all emerged okay.</p></dd>
<dt>30.8.59 Abberton Res.</dt>
<dd><p>During the Monday evening of the 24th Aug, RL &amp; myself visited Abberton res; We saw our very first &#9794; Crossbill which showed up very red, it only stayed long enough for identification before it flew undulating across the meadows. The water was quite low &amp; revealed quite a bit of mud. Species on here were Snipe, Purple Sandpiper, Ringed Plover &amp; many Wagtails Herons &amp; Pochard &amp; Teal were also seen.</p></dd>
