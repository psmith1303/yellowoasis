<dd><p>With B.F. G.E. &amp; D an American cousin on G.E. we pitched a tent &amp; stayed the previous evening &amp; part of the nights in the wood. We tried nothing at dusk with the M/V bulb, but as the evening was very cool not much more than gross type moths &amp; icneuman flies appeared.</p></dd>
<dd><p>After a few hours Sleep, we were up &amp; out by 2.45 &amp; the morning was cold &amp; foggy. Bird song was very low &amp; the first bird heard was a Cuckoo followed by the Wren &amp; Crows &amp; Rook, plenty of Blackbird song &amp; Song &amp; Missel through, Blackcaps were later &amp; Skylark &amp; various tits, Pigeon then Whitethroat, the chorus got a little more volume by five am but was quite disappointing as a whole. [Pencil comment: Photographed young Rook]</p></dd>
<dd><p>After breakfast we wanted down toward the river &amp; the old willows, where a Green Woodpecker was seen &amp; plenty of Starlings, the Marsh tit was still sitting on its eggs, or young in a hollow tree, in the hedgerow.</p></dd>
<dd><p>[Pencil comment: Wheatear seen in nearby fields big &amp; very pink looking]</p></dd>
<dt>7 June 1960</dt>
<dd><p>During the evening GE BF &amp; myself visited Donyland woods to inspect a tree previously found by B/F for a woodpecker&rsquo;s nest, this proved false. However we did find another nest hole, very much blackened by exudance from the hole, when we got close G.E. &amp; I heard young birds, &amp; withdrawing back down from view watched the bird return but not enter the nest. We watched for a good 8 minutes &amp; then the bird made off very quickly, as we didn&rsquo;t want to disturb her we made off as well.</p></dd>
