      <p>&hellip;trying for the hairstreaks, on meeting him we asked his luck &amp; he looked up &amp; presented us with a Comma &amp; with another twinkle in his eye produced two nice fact &#9792; Black Hairstreaks, so the collecting honours were his. Worth of noted were two nice heads of Heath spotted orchid, the very nice Creeping Jenny was plentiful, as was Common Centuary with a few white heads. There were many plants of Musk Mallow. The Wayfaring tree was in bloom. There was a big variety of beautiful Sedges &amp; grass whicih I did not know. Self-Heal was quite abundant.</p>

<p>The bird population was not much in evidence &amp; we only saw Wood-Pigeon, only hearing a Bullfinch woodpecers, Chiffchaff and this was about all.</p>

<p>Two mammals I asw were Stoat &amp; Hare both moving accross rides.
We left soon after 3 oclock &amp; we had all enjoyed our visit in the sweltering sunshine, on arrival home the time was approx. 6pm.</p>
