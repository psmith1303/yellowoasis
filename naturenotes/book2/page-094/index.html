      <p>From Strasbourg we journeyed via the Frieburg Road till we reached Furtwangen. The weather here was absolutely atrocious &amp; rained hard in which conditions we pitched our tent. Prior to this we stopped at Appenweier for petrol &amp; observed a S. Flycatcher on some electric wires. From this place we decided to make for the Black forest regions &amp; stopped first night in a wood near St Peter, this was a very very wet night &amp; we got very wet even under the quite thick trees, the tent was sodden &amp; came through in places to wet our sleeping bags.</p>

<p>In the morning we made breakfast still in the rain &amp; fog which quickly turned into hue snowflakes, this continued halfway through the morning when the snow stopped but the fog persisted until lunch time. During a short break we collected a few orchids &amp; other plants &amp; admired the beautiful abundant flora.</p>

<p>We motored on to a place called Titisee where our spirits we raised by having an excellent meal in a restaurant. During this time the sun came out &amp; so did the tourists for this is a lakeland beauty spot. The sun soon went in &amp; we had a quick look around the shopping places in the rain &amp; then carried on to Felburg [Feldburg] through a snow storm. Felburg is Germany&rsquo;s highest place a approx. 4.900. The scenery en route was really lovely &amp; looked well even through the blizzard. We were still in very low spirits as we tried to find somewhere to stop the night. This proved difficult, but we finally stopped at a placed called Kurve walter which is as it seemed a health resort, it was of course still raining.</p>

<p>The next morning being Whit Monday saw a few people going to church we decided to look around the woods where we were, as we had heard a calling woodpecker the previous evening.</p>
