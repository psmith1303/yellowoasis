      <p>We hadn&rsquo;t finished with woodpeckers, as we were discussing the events, a &#9792; G.S.W. settled quite close on a decaying oak tree limb &amp; began to chip away at the bark, of which now &amp; then its removed quite large pieces, this afforded us very good views of its plumage &amp; we noted buffish breast colour, crimson under-tail feathers &amp; glossy black back &amp; head &amp; the normal white patches. This bird came to an adjacent tree, when I gave a woodpecker call, but whether or not it was curious, I couldn&rsquo;t say &amp; when it spotted us, it made off again with its dipping flight.</p>

<p>Brian decided to watch the hole in the tree from which grass &amp; sticks were showing, from the hide. I left him &amp; went off towards the river. Halfway down the slope to the river, an oak bole is covered in ivy &amp; onto this from the leaves at the base of the tree, sprung a very nice darkish Red squirrel, I watched it from about eight feet, I moved slightly &amp; it also moved a little higher, stopped &amp; scorned me with a sort of grunting noise, then up a little higher it moved, into the broad sunlight. I left it in piece &amp; carried on to sit for a while on the ridge watching at the same time the gorse bush where we found a Long tailed tits nest. I didn&rsquo;t see the birds anywhere. After a few minutes, I went back into the wood. The windflowers were out, but not in profusion as yet. A few primroses were still blooming &amp; one or two quite early bluebells.</p>

<p>Nothing was in a squirrels dray which I climbed up to, as I made my way back to B.F. he reported Nuthatches &amp; tree creepers we about, he then suggested we should try a picture of the squirrel I had seen, so off we went, we saw it again but it was down the trunk &amp; off accross the woodland floor&hellip;</p>
