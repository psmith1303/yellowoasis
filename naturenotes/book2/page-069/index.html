      <p>&hellip;the pine-wind breaks. A few Chaffinches &amp; Linnets here &amp; more pheasants &amp; partridges, a Green Woodpecker flew up &amp; away from the bracken, we heard this bird several times during the rest of the day.</p>

<p>We spotted quite a flock sparrows with Tree sparros among them. We decided after this to have our lunch early &amp; it rained nastily whilst we sat under a hedge &amp; had it. After this we moved over the ground again to the sandy area which is eroded &amp; here to our delight were a nice pair of Wheatears - our first for &lsquo;61. We watched these display flight. I found a beetle on the heather, which looked to me to be a Dor beetle, but it seems early for these, to be identified by Nigel Cumming.</p>

<p>Once again we saw a Stone Curlew as it flew off out of sight on long barred wings.</p>

<p>As the weather worsened, the visibility became poorer, so we decided we should be going on our way home, we had fair views of the birds we had come to see &amp; were thankful the weather hung out fine enough for us to see them. We got quite wet around our feet going home but we enjoyed our visit, which was G.E.&rsquo;s first.</p>

<p>A small white flower was blooming &amp; so was a Cranesbill of a type to be identified.</p>

<p>The beetle was identified as the Minotaur Beetle (Typhaeus Thyphaeus) by N/C.</p>
