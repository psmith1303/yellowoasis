      <p>With G.E. B.F. &amp; D. we arrived by 7.30am &amp; parked m/cycles &amp; straight away into the shrike field, here we saw Bullfinches &amp; Whitethroats &amp; Linnets &amp; a Spotted flycatcher, further down by the river we saw a Sedge warbler &amp; two Tree Sparrows, whilst swallows hawked up &amp; down. With the arrival of Mr Dickie we crossed over the pipe &amp; along to the hedgerow where the G.W.&rsquo;s nest was, we carried on past here &amp; along to the big Elm tree where the Kestrel is nesting, we all climbed up &amp; were delighted to see the 5 young looking quite big &amp; healthy. B.F. took another photograph, as we want to record the stages of growth, they were a fortnight old this day, their down was grey now &amp; not white, the feet &amp; cere showed up quite yellow. One young was photographed in the hand, to give some idea of size at two weeks. Well pleased we left here &amp; walked back to the woodpecker hedgerow, when we neared the suspected nest a G.Woodpecker flew out from the hedge &amp; I eagerly climbed to the hole only to find it was not a proper excavation, so we searched along the hedge &amp; I looked in an old hole found previously &amp; heard the young woodpeckers inside these we recorded &amp; looked at through G.E. patent light nicknamed a Shuftie-scope, which worked very well. The young were still naked &amp; blind &amp; numbered five. B.F. camouflaged himself in an attempt to get a picture, but the bird, after a very quick appearance at the tree, frightened off very quickly, so Brian rejoined us, as we were&hellip;</p>
