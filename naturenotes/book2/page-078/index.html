      <p>With G.E. &amp; B.F. to the wood. G.E. &amp; B.F. arrived earlier &amp; I made it by 8.15am. I wandered through the wood on my own for a while, as George &amp; Brian were down by the river. Much bird song greeted me, G.Woodpecker, Starling, Chiffchaff, Robins, Rooks, Jackdaws Wrens &amp; tits &amp; many other all mingling in one chorus. Through to the Western side of the wood I stopped under &amp; lovely large spreading oak tree &amp; watched Nuthatches peeping above me, the a Kestrel-like bird swooped in &amp; settled in the top of the later leafed Ash tree &amp; then began to cuckoo this was my first &lsquo;61 view of the cuckoo. Much bird activity was further enhanced by a nice view of my first &lsquo;61 Blackcap. Pigeons flew over &amp; clapped their wings &amp; pheasants &amp; Partridges called out. A G.S. Woodpecker started drumming in the previous places, we had heard before, &amp; the yaffle sounded out many times all round the wood. The weather started off quite bright &amp; fairly warm, but at about this time a shower of rain started for a while, but soon cleared up, during the rest of the morning it was very sunny.</p>

<p>George &amp; Brian came through the wood &amp; we walked back to where the Nuthatches were pecking out a hole previously mentioned in the notes of before, I was at it again &amp; flew on &amp; off as tits &amp; starlings came near, this gave us very good views &amp; we heard the calls very clearly, finally it flew off, so we went through the woods &amp; down to the river as far as the pipe, we sat on this &amp; had coffee&hellip;</p>
