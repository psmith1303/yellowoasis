      <p>&hellip;&amp; about five birds flew off &amp; circled around in the strong wind calling harsh &ldquo;franks&rdquo;. Brian &ldquo;geared up&rdquo; with tripod &amp; camera after a minute or two, a presumed &#9792; came up against the air currents, checked wing primaries &amp; secondaries, tail &amp; feet, landed on our outer bough. From here it walked down the trench with the grace &amp; majesty of a queen, then it settled on its nest &amp; all we could see was an uptilted orange bill over the edge of the nest. A nearby nest, where another bird had taken off from, was better for photography so Brian moved round a little bit. Several times this bird - with a couple of primaries missing - tried an up wind approach, but didn&rsquo;t make it, this gave us a chance to observe wonderful &amp; graceful aerial manouvers, as it swept up in the air currnet, missed its chance, flew on a few wing beats, turned &amp; hurtled around the edge of the wood before coming up again for another try. The wind was very strong &amp; definitely made these big birds use these tactics, it wasn&rsquo;t our presence which shyed them off, as when we did leave &amp; well away from the wood, I looked back &amp; watched the performance all over again. Brian managed one exposure. G.E. &amp; I left Brian in a set-up position &amp; looked around the wood at the other nests, all very white looking from droppings &amp; not as large as I had imagined the structure would be. Below the nest&rsquo;s trees we fond several large pellets, mainly fur (water vole?) &amp; a few bones. George found a nice breast feather.</p>
