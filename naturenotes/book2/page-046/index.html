      <p>Our first stop of the day was at Eriswell Brecklands, where the C.N.H.S. led by J. Firmin saw the rare plant of Breckland Catchfly (Silene Otites), there was only one plant seen, nearby was Long storked Cranesbill, Hounds tongue, Common Melliot, Vipers Bugloss, &amp; theother more common species. These were all along the road verge. We crossed over to the Brecks proper &amp; saw two &#9792; Wheatears &amp; two Woodlarks, going further we disturbed several Stone Curlew which afforded us excellent view &amp; we all heard their call very clearly. After this we returned to rear the coach &amp; had lunch in very warm sunshine, most pleasant.</p>

<p>We moved on after lunch, to Grimes Graves &amp; looked in both excavations. In one I found a bat hooked up, but we did not identify it. The chalk area about here, showed up Carline thistle &amp; Dwarf thistle Eyebright, Yellowwort. Red Fleabane &amp; other common species. Several Field Voles were seen darting away in the Heather &amp; grass. A Kestrel was also seen here.</p>

<p>Our next move took us to Fowl mere, after much deviating &amp; exploring we finally found the mere. J.F. &amp; I went ahead first &amp; on the mere were quite a few birds, Coot, Pochard, Teal, Gadwell, Moorhen, &amp; Little Grebe seemed numerous here &amp; there. A pair of Mute Swan &amp; young, as well as the usual Moorhens. The Gadwell numbered approx 40 &amp; took off before the rest of the party&hellip;</p>
