      <p>&hellip;beautiful spot where of course we were after the Lulworth skipper which was not very plentiful. The Chalk hill blue was quite common here &amp; the Brown Argus. I only saw one Marbled White &amp; one or two common blues. Here one again the Grayling was plentiful. There were quite a few Dark Green Frittilaries worm &amp; egg laying, but going very fast in the breeze on the very very steep slopes.</p>

<p>We saw a party of 4 to five immature Stonechats, &amp; plenty of Linnets &amp; Goldfinches. We saw one hawk which could possibly have been a Peregrine, but really to distant for sure identification. Herring Gulls one again on the cliffs. Many more Lingards here as well as grasshoppers &amp; Red-ants. The plant life was good, with many heads of the Carline Thistle about. Clustered bellflower abundant. On the plateau were a few plants here &amp; there of Dyers Greenweed a nice yellow Brown looking plant, there was once again the normal commoner chalk plants. I should mention one other plant quite common in these areas, the Common Valerian. I also saw some Montbresia growing in a wild state but I doubt its being naturally wild, as can be said for some Evening primrose at Lulworth. During train journeys I noticed quite a lot of Cottongrass along the stretch of the New Forest. The weather during this whole period was very changeable being cloudy sunny &amp; warm. Windy &amp; showery, but we enjoyed it most of the time.</p>
