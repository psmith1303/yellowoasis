      <p>Plant life was well underway now &amp; plenty of Bluebells &amp; Wood Anemones out in bloom, still a few primroses, the Archangel was in bloom &amp; see for the first time of 1961, very nice. Wood &amp; dog violets were also plentiful &amp; patches of Greater Stitchwort, White deadnettle &amp; still in profusion Dog Mercury.</p>

<p>Many starlings were about the old holes in the ash trees &amp; whilst watching the a Nuthatch appeared, we watched for a while &amp; saw another nearby inspect a hole which had freshly chipped marks all round it, all of a sudden a Blue tit went to the hole &amp; was immediately attacked by the Nuthatch, both birds clashed &amp; descended in a fighting ball &amp; many feather came adrift &amp; floated by us. the birds parted &amp; the tit flew off to a tree nearby. The other nuthatch inspected the hole again &amp; had a little peck &amp; flew off, calling loudly.</p>

<p>We decided to erect the hide nearby to watch them so off we went for our equipment &amp; the hide, putting it up when we came back a few feet from the tree, which was an ash.</p>

<p>We had coffee whilst watching &amp; did a little recording. Again the Tit &amp; Nuthatch skirmished in the same way as before &amp; then again after that. The Nuthatches went off &amp; the tit entered the hole &amp; stayed in it for over ten minutes, when the bird flew out quickly as it heard a Nuthatch alight near the hole, again a skirmish &amp; feathers.</p>

<p>A greater spotted was drumming loudly to our right, so I left Brian &amp; George to see if I could see it. On my sway towards the drumming noise, I saw several excited Blue tits, just as we had seen them in little flocks, chasing each other&hellip;</p>
