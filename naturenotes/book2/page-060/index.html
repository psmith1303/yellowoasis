      <p>From about 9.30am G.E., B.F. and myself went to Col. Mangles wood. The first thing we did was to climb to the top of a pine tree to investigate what we thought was a squirrels dray - no luck, it turned out to be an old magpie&rsquo;s nest. After Brian had photographed me descending the tree we walked down the wood. I espied an old tree well pecked &amp; two more holes in it, as we got closer a Great Tit went into the hole, but came out &amp; flew off, to stay around the trees. A hole in another tree, which we had observed last week contained fresh twigs &amp; we stepped back to watch awhile, whilst we watched the tree several birds flew around Blue tit, Tree Creeper, Nuthatches, Marsh tits &amp; 1 Long tailed tit. A Greater Spotted Woodpecker &#9792;, alighted on a birch quite close in a Starling stance, which we took it to be at first &amp; George pointed it out, it flew off. A few minutes later it must have circled round &amp; we could hear it pecking. We moved up to near where the old well pecked tree was, then I spotted it on an oak tree we had fairly good views before it flew off again. Brian stayed by the pecked tree with his camera &amp; tripod hoping to snap the tit going in the hole again.
