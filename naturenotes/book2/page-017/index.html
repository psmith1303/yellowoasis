<dd><p>&hellip;said that there had been a movement of these birds from the previous day.</p></dd>
<dd><p>I continued a short way along the naze back water beach and here I saw a party of Turnstone in summer plumage, very handsome, with two grey plover and one Sanderling and here and there were pairs of Ringed Plover.</p></dd>
<dd><p>Quite an experience was had when I first spotted a &#9794; Eider preening way out on a mud flat alone. When after a few minutes I came back this bird was nearly on the beach where I was able to approach it to about 25ft and make a sketch before it took to the water. There was no visible sign of injury, but this tame act seemed to good for a normal healthy shy sort of bird as is the drake eider. After this I worked my way back, not seeing any other unusual birds. Walking back along the beach, I noticed all the way along the cliffs - an abundance of Coltsfoot, as we discovered last year. I departed at approximately 12 oclock.</p></dd>
<dt>29.3.59 Abberton Res.</dt>
<dd><p>A short visit to the resavoir on a cold and windy day. As to be expected, most birds were under cover. The species I did see were as follows. Reed Bunting. Coots. G.C.Grebes. Teal. Heron. Tufted Ducks. Mute swans. Rooks. B.H.Gulls. Mallard. My visit&rsquo;s purpose was the hope of seeing arriving migrants, but still the wind are not favourable.</p></dd>
