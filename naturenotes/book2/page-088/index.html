      <p>&hellip;&#9794; perched higher up. After our snack &amp; coffee we decided to move away from the pasture area &amp; down to where the clump of Willow trees grow by the river &amp; old tark trap. As we approached, I saw a Carrion Crow, leave a nest we had discovered earlier, so to get over to the &ldquo;island&rdquo; we had to walk down stream &amp; over the wooden bridge &amp; back along the river. I climbed up to the nest, it was quite difficult &amp; the strong wind made the trees sway a lot, but I reached the nest okay &amp; peered over the edge to see a nicely formed cup well lined, containing one newly hatched chick &amp; one egg, which was cracked &amp; the chick inside moving the shell up &amp; down. In these conditions a photographic record was to difficult.</p>

<p>From this area we back tracked to the bridge &amp; noted Buchanans Speedwell &amp; Pennywort &amp; Red Campion &amp; primroses &amp; numerous small flowers among these spotted Medick, carrying on over the &ldquo;shrike field area&rdquo; I pointed out one or two plants of Early purple orchis, again as he didn&rsquo;t see them earlier.</p>

<p>A noise attracted us to the river, where we saw the Garrison Beagle being exercised, these were running wild &amp; we decided to go back through the wood up to the long tailed tits nest which we found had been pulled to pieces by a predator, as was probably the case of a Blackbirds nest nearby. The Cuckoo flowers here nearly all had Orange tip eggs on them, these we collected for breeding or rather rearing. Through the thickets &amp; down to the river again on the way stopping for a Whitethroat recording. More Cuckoo flower in the lower mead, but no orange tip eggs here,&hellip;</p>
