      <p>&hellip;out &amp; flew off again, to return soon with another leaf section. There was more than one bee in the timbers.</p>

<p>A Kestrel was hovering &amp; soaring overhead in the thermal currents of air &amp; Green Woodpeckers called out around us.</p>

<p>Dickie, George &amp; I left the others &amp; we went off across the fields &amp; round by the river to the small copse. A Green Sandpiper flew up from the bend in the river &amp; Swallows hawked flies above us. High up many swifts were &ldquo;playing&rdquo; in the very fine clear sunny sky. We carried on across the marshy ground &amp; over a dried up dyke to the small pond. Again we saw the nice fern like plant (still unidentified) by the muddy waters edge, also growing on the drier steepish banks were Creeping jenny. Over in the woody slopes we found Common enchanters night-shade. Yellow Bedstraw was very common here, Whilst checking over the plants G.E. &amp; I looked up to see a bird fly towards the pond, we thought at first it was a Moorhen, but with a duck-like flight it landed by a large bramble bush &amp; disappeared, not before G.E. had his binoculars on it and identified it clearly as a Water-Rail. It did not reappear although we tried to flush it from the bush. This was the first time either of us had seen a Water-rail. By this pond we noticed mating dragonflies of Reddish &amp; blue coloured, the latter much a smaller-species.</p>

<p>We left here &amp; returned across the marsh &amp; dyke &amp; over the bridge by Rock farm, up the track through to gate to our Motorcycles the time being 12-15.</p>

<p>Of note were the good numbers of Large &amp; small white&hellip;</p>
