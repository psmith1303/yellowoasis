      <p>On Sunday, June 18th, twenty four hours after our previous visit we found that the amount of growth was absolutely amazing, their backs were now completely covered by feathers with only small patches of down adhering here and there. This same day a parent bird was seen hawking for some considerable time in the vicinity of the nest, the first time it had been seen hunting so close. Owing to the advanced stage of the eyas&rsquo;s, three females and two males, arrangements were made to have them banded. On Sunday, June 25th, this was carried out. The young were now fully fledged and very handsome, with rufous heads striated dark brown and rufous mantles heavily barred with dark brown. Their underparts were creamy brown also striated with a darker brown, backs and rumps were much paler than the mantle. Both sexes were alike except for the tails. The males were pale grey/blue with a broad black band at the end, whilst the females were uniform brown barred with darker brown and a larger band at the end.</p>

<p>Whilst the banding operations were in progress, the adult birds remained on their usual perch in the oak. The young remained quite docile whilst being rung, with the exception of the aggressive female who contrived to leave her mark on the finger of one member of the party.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, June 28th, a final visit was paid to the nest which was found to be deserted - the young had flown.</p>

<p>In this the age of fast vanishing wildlife and particularly when the kestrel is reported to be declining in numbers, and records of its nesting have become fewer, this brief acquaintance with a family of these beautiful birds has been a deeply rewarding experience for the writers. &ldquo;Our&rdquo; young kestrels are still to be seen hawking, and it is hoped that 1962 will find them nesting and successfully rearing their own young.</p>
