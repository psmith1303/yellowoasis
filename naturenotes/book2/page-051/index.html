      <p>With Russell Leavett to Leewick. The weather was rainy &amp; the clouds cleared now &amp; then to give sunny periods. There was a slight breeze.</p>

<p>We arrived at about 10.10, &amp; after parking the motor-bike we walked along the beach towards Brightlingsea disturbing Redshanks as we went. The Cormorants as usual were sitting on theposts in the sea &amp; they flew off in the direction we were going. We went into a hut at the old sand works &amp; left our food bags &amp; carried on. More Cormorants passed us towards the mud flats which the outgoing tide exposed.</p>

<p>Feeding along the waters edge were quite a few Sanderling &amp; parties of about eight Oyster Catchers, which were piping away merrily. Two Turnstones were feeding &amp; we watched them awhile as they turned many quite large stones. Half way along this beach we saw Bar tailed Godwit feeding with two Grey Plovers &amp; more Sanderling. Gulls were flying about most of the time including (Herring, G.B.B. &amp; Black headed) as well as more Cormorants passed by, further along were more parties of Oyster Catchers.</p>

<p>We walked all the way to the harbour area where this is an old barge which is derelict, here we saw approx a dozen Brent Geese, there were some more on the mud-flats about six in number &amp; these were with G.B.B&rsquo;s &amp; more Cormorants.
Birds we saw out in the water, were Cormorants &amp; three&hellip;</p>
