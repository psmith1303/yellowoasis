      <p>&hellip;a Heron, which &ldquo;lit&rdquo; down in a watery ditch, George &amp; I stalked within eighteen feet before it flew up &amp; away.</p>

<p>We decided to look at the Lesser spotted woodpeckers hole in the tree in the hedge, nothing else had happened around it recently so we started to return to the wood, as we turned, we spotted a dead wood-pigeon, which, when I waded accross was found to be headless. (probably taken by a fox) &amp; all its feathers were lying around its corpse, we then saw a Long tailed tit alight &amp; take a feather. George followed its flight to a nearby gorse bush, on closer investigation we found a very nice nest was externally completed, we backed away &amp; over the river. The pair of birds appeared from behind us &amp; flew directly to the nest, we hope to photograph this later.</p>

<p>Into the wood again, this wee more &ldquo;wildflowers&rdquo; have come out, some bluebells have buds, but generally not a great more in the botany world to notice as yet.</p>

<p>As prearranged we called a &ldquo;Curlew&rdquo; call to Brian when we were parallel with him, he soon reached us &amp; we left the wood, as a Green Woodpecker flew up the ride.</p>

<p>After consuming our coffee at G.E.&rsquo;s house in the warm, I preceeded G.E. &amp; B.F. on my M/C &amp; left it at my home, picking up Brian &amp; George again in Brian&rsquo;s combination M/C. from home we went to Stoke by Nayland &amp; after finding a game-keeper named Ramon, he got out his M/C &amp; guided us to the best place &amp; nearest we could get to the Heronry by M/C. After a few words he left us trio &amp; we walked across the sown field to the Heronry.</p>

<p>There were eighteen nests as far as we could see &amp; count&hellip;</p>
